```


# Level 12

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

```bash
$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
```


# Level 13

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

```bash
$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
```
